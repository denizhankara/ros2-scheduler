# ScheduleSprint

ScheduleSprint is a ROS2 scheduling paradigm designed for efficiently managing heterogeneous priority tasks in distributed system applications. This repository contains the implementation and supporting code for ScheduleSprint, a priority-based scheduler for ROS2 systems that aims to replace the existing scheduling scheme.

## Overview

The primary goal of ScheduleSprint is to prioritize messages based on their importance, ensuring efficient and timely processing of tasks. Our system builds upon the edge-server structure detection capabilities of ROS2 and introduces new components and experimental results to demonstrate the limitations of the current ROS2 scheduler.

In this project, we have implemented various heterogeneous sampling schemes and system configurations to comprehensively evaluate ScheduleSprint's performance. To create realistic and inspiring simulations, we have also devised several different generating policies. Our system is demonstrated in the context of an object detection pipeline with heterogeneous target priorities as a motivating case study, showcasing how our design decisions lead to a more efficient implementation of widely used systems.

## Features

* Priority-based message scheduling for ROS2 distributed systems
